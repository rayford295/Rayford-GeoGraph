## Summary

Uses generative vision models to synthesize post-disaster street-level views from satellite imagery, bridging remote sensing and ground-level interpretation.

## Repository Snapshot

The companion repository includes figures, dataset references, training and test code, result samples, and evaluation folders for LLM-based and ResNet-based assessment. Its README frames the project as a cross-view generation benchmark for synthesizing post-disaster street views from satellite and remote-sensing inputs.

## Evaluated Methods

The repository compares Pix2Pix, Stable Diffusion 1.5 with ControlNet, ControlNet with VLM guidance, and a Disaster-MoE design. The README reports that SD 1.5 plus ControlNet achieves the strongest semantic consistency, with F1 around 0.71 under the reported classifier evaluation.

## Why the Repository Matters

The code structure makes this node more than a concept paper: it contains training, testing, sample results, and multiple evaluation paths. That turns the graph edge from satellite imagery to street-view disaster evidence into a reproducible research artifact.

## Support

The repository notes support from the Texas A&M University Environment and Sustainability Initiative through the Environment and Sustainability Graduate Fellow Award.

## Impact

This paper opens a new branch in the graph by moving from analysis to generation, which makes the broader research program feel forward-looking and distinctive.
